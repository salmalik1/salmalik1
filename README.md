- 👋 Hi, I’m @salmalik1
- 👀 I’m interested in building integrations with SaaS platforms as well as standalone node/TypeScript applications that leverage open source LLMs that have been deployed to any (AWS, Azure, GCP) cloud provider using Terraform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various open source LLMs and when to use what model
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything GenAI related
